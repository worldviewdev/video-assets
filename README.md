# 📁 video-assets

This public GitHub repository is intended to store static video and image files used for frontend delivery.

All assets are served via [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) to ensure fast, global access across web applications, landing pages, or documentation.

Assets in this repository are publicly accessible and optimized for use in production environments that require lightweight, serverless hosting of media content.

> Note: All files must be committed to the `main` branch to be accessible via CDN.
